# Shell-Implementation

## Version 0.0
Reference the other author's work , and do the practices , and then get this version.
To distinguish the other works of mine , using version number to reach the goal.

## Version 0.1
Goal is to using own shell to manipulate, using own compiler to compile , and using own filesystem to store the file.

*Function provide (manipulation on it) , and it's return value: 
	*exit : 0
	*help : 1
	*ls : 2
	*on disk : 3 
	*on file : 4
	*compile : 5
